documentation template
============

A simple guide to help you create documentation that effectively explains what your open source project does, how it came about, how you're using it, and how it can benefit the community at large.

Good, clear documentation:
 - enables other Gilt engineers to understand what your project does and how we’re using it. 
 - helps the OS community at large to understand, what your project does, why you created it, how we’re using it to get work done and how they can start using it/fixing bugs/building it out
 - helps gilttech as a whole to better promote your project, with the goals of helping you to get work done via time + ideas contributed by the OS community; building your personal reputation as a developer; and building #gilttech’s reputation as an innovative, experimental team.

What you need:
### 1. One- to three-sentence blurb highlighting the primary things your project does
<strong>Example</strong>: Schema Evolution Manager makes it very simple for engineers to contribute schema changes to a postgresql database, managing the schema evolutions as proper source code. Schema changes are deployed as gzipped tarballs named with the corresponding git tag. 

<strong>Format Breakdown</strong>: [Project name] [does this thing/these things]. It is useful to [whom].
### 2. Answer: Who is the audience?
Think about the problem your project solves, and who in the tech world is likely to be trying to solve that problem.
